            violence often brings about momentary results. Nations have frequently won their independence in battle. But
            in spite of temporary victories, violence never brings permanent peace.

          <p>When people come to you for help, do not turn them off with pious words, saying, 'Have faith and take your troubles
            to God.' Act instead as though there were no God, as though there were only one person in the world who could
            help -- only yourself.

            happen in a man's life. As we live, we grow and our beliefs change. They must change. So I think we should live
            with this constant discovery. We should be open to this adventure in heightened awareness of living. We should
            stake our whole existence on our willingness to explore and experience.

          <br>
          <p>
            Dear President-Elect Obama,
            <br>
            <br> As a group of women leaders who have given our lives to the transformation, protection and empowerment of women
            in the United States and globally, we want to begin by congratulating you. We are honored and proud to have you
            lead the nation during this historic time. We also welcome your call to action, reminding us of what we have
            always known — that as global citizens we cannot solely rely on any one administration's ability to bring about
            change, but must be steadfast in pushing forward our own vision and agendas.
            <br>
            <br> We represent an historic movement for change: millions of women across the globe with innovative ideas, influential
            constituencies and collaborative solutions. We are calling on you to ensure that women are equally represented
            in everything, from your administration's infrastructure to its decision-making and solution building. We are
            calling on you to exercise leadership in dismantling the structures that perpetuate gender inequality, impede
            women's full participation in society and thwart real progress for people around the world.
            <br>
            <br> As war rages in Gaza, it is clear that the time has come to dismantle militarism as the dominant ideology in
            world politics. We must ensure that women take the lead in building lasting peace in the Middle East, ending
            genocide in Darfur, stopping femicide in the Democratic Republic of Congo, fighting the War on Terror in Afghanistan,
            and ending the war in Iraq.
            <br>
            <br> Though the select-few women who hold leadership positions in this country's political system inspire us; women
            represent more than 50% of the population and deserve more than marginal representation. We believe that in order
            for your vision of change to succeed, women must be in positions of power. While US women gained the right to
            vote 100 years ago, to date only 14% of the US Congress are women. This must change.
            <br>
            <br> The major economic, security, governance and environmental challenges of our times cannot be solved without
            the equal participation of women at all levels of society — from the home to institutions of national and global
            governance. Women's voices must be central in all major discussions including the economic crisis, overhauling
            our education system. Long-term investments in women's education, health and leadership development are equally
            critical. Economic structures continue to marginalize women. Consider this: women represent two-thirds of the
            world's labor yet we own less than 1% of the world's assets.
            <br>
            <br> In addition, more than 500,000 women die each year because of inadequate medical and reproductive care. Violence
            against women is a pandemic that determines women's realities, impeding their access to education and economic
            self-sufficiency. This global epidemic is undermining the future of the world, as women are at the heart of all
            communities and families; we literally carry the future in our bodies.
            <br>
            <br> Yet these are not "women's issues". In fact, such investments are vital to economic growth and the well-being
            of all individuals, communities, societies and nations. Consider India's economic transformation of the past
            15 years: The World Bank finds that states with the highest percentage of women in the labor force grew the fastest
            and had the largest reductions in poverty.
            <br>
            <br> As policy makers, activists, researchers, and grant-makers we have spent our lives investing in women and know
            that these kinds of investments have immeasurable and fundamental impact for the better. Worldwide, women are
            uniquely positioned to bring innovative insights and creative solutions to global leadership forums. If we hope
            to improve existing economic, peace and security, and human development frameworks women must not only be included,
            but must be at the heart of the discussion.
            <br>
            <br> We are calling on you to be the President who ushers in the time of women. Our vision of the future is one in
            which women and men are equal partners, standing shoulder to shoulder in confronting the world's challenges.
            We welcome, with hope and anticipation, your shared commitment to this vision.
            <br>
            <br> We represent more than half of the world's human potential. And our time has come.
            <br>
            <br> Sincerely,
            <br>
